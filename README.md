## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome aboard! This project is a data science journey into one of the most famous maritime disasters in history — the **Titanic sinking**. Our goal? To uncover the factors that influenced survival and **predict who survived** using powerful machine learning models.

Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, this notebook delves into the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle, performing **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, **data preprocessing**, and **modeling**. We visualize relationships, clean the dataset, and apply classifiers to forecast survival outcomes with clarity and accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Comprehensive Data Exploration**  
  Visual analysis using seaborn and matplotlib to explore key survival factors.

- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering & Cleaning**  
  Smart transformations, imputation, and handling of missing values.

- 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**  
  Trained multiple classifiers to predict survival — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more!

- 📈 **Model Evaluation**  
  Metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation to assess model performance.

## 📁 Dataset Used

We used the [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) which includes:

- PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age
- Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
- Pclass (Passenger Class), SibSp, Parch
- Survived (Target Variable)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Here are some key insights:

- **Women** and **children** had a higher survival rate.
- **First-class passengers** were more likely to survive.
- Passengers boarding from port **'C' (Cherbourg)** had a better chance of survival.

🧠 Feature engineering was done on:
- Title extraction from names
- Family size creation from SibSp & Parch
- Handling missing Age, Embarked, and Fare values smartly
