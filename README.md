## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome aboard! This project is a data science journey into one of the most famous maritime disasters in history — the **Titanic sinking**. Our goal? To uncover the factors that influenced survival and **predict who survived** using powerful machine learning models.

Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, this notebook delves into the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle, performing **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, **data preprocessing**, and **modeling**. We visualize relationships, clean the dataset, and apply classifiers to forecast survival outcomes with clarity and accuracy.
